# ember-portfolio

_A personal portfolio project based on Ember 3.x and Firebase Firestore._

### Goals

1. An opportunity to get up-to-speed on the changes to Ember in 3.10 that have taken place since my last Ember project in 2.x. I built a different iteration using Ember Octane edition which was _AWESOME_ (go decorators!), but it did not play nice with many ember addons so I abandoned it.

2. Fiddling with the new Emberfire 3.x using Firestore instead of the Realtime Database which I had relied on in the past. The Emberfire project hasn't been getting a lot of love lately, so I'd like a chance to provide feedback for the new major version. Firestore relationships are... hard, but I really believe in Firebase for those of us who don't exactly love writing backends.

3. Building a non-traditional navigation scheme. I don't put a lot of stock in portfolio websites or custom blogs anymore, so I really don't care if people dislike my navigation- I just want to try something new and weird. If you really hate it, just know that it came to me in a dream and I had to do it.

4. Writing a custom Markdown interpreter. I may still use Medium or Ghost for my day-to-day journaling needs, but I would like to experiment with some custom components to wrap experimental Markdown implementations.

5. Typescript in Ember. I enjoyed using Typescript in React projects, and now this is a chance for me to implement it in an Ember project.
